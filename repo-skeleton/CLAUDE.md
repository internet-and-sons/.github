# Project context — {{repo-name}}

This file is auto-loaded as project context whenever Claude Code is opened in this repo. Read it first, then read the companion files below as the task requires.

## What this repo is

<!-- Two or three sentences explaining what this repo does and how it fits
     into the broader internet-and-sons collection (if at all — many repos
     stand alone). Plain language. Pretend a coworker who's never seen it
     just landed in the directory. -->

{{Plain-language description of the repo. Include: what it produces, who
runs it, what other repos (if any) it depends on or feeds into, and
whether it's public or private.}}

## Companion files (read as the task warrants)

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — read before any change. Setup, version-bumping flow (if applicable), what NOT to change without coordination.
- **`TODO.md`** — pending work, deferred decisions, done log. Read when continuing in-flight work or scoping new tasks.
- **`LEARNINGS.md`** — non-obvious gotchas. Read before editing the parts of the repo where past gotchas have lived.

Org-wide rules live in [`internet-and-sons/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/internet-and-sons/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). Read that once when you join the org; it covers branching, PRs, and the merge policy that applies to every repo here.

## Hard rules (always apply, never override)

<!-- The rules in this section are inviolable for this repo. The first one
     is inherited from the org. Add repo-specific safety rules below it —
     things that, if violated, would cause real damage. Be specific.

     Examples from other repos:
       - "never call articleUpdate with isPublished: true"
       - "don't rename files SKILL.md references"
       - "never log API keys to stdout"
       - "never push directly to a public release tag"

     If you don't have any yet, leave just the org rule and add more as
     the repo matures. -->

1. **Every change goes through a PR.** No direct pushes to `main`. See [`internet-and-sons/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/internet-and-sons/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full policy.

{{Add repo-specific hard rules here as they emerge.}}

## Git commit rules

When committing changes, create **separate commits per file**. Do NOT bundle multiple file changes into a single commit. Each file gets its own commit with a descriptive message specific to that file's changes.

For example, if `README.md`, `best-practice/claude-subagents.md`, and a skill file all changed:

1. `git add README.md` → commit with a README-specific message
2. `git add best-practice/claude-subagents.md` → commit with a subagents-doc-specific message
3. `git add .claude/skills/weather-fetcher/SKILL.md` → commit with a skill-specific message

This keeps git history clean and makes individual changes easy to review, revert, or cherry-pick.

## Quick orientation

<!-- A table mapping paths to what they are. Useful for fast navigation
     when Claude (or a contributor) is searching for where something
     lives. Delete if your repo is too small to need one. -->

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `{{path}}` | {{description}} |

## Need help?

If you're unsure whether a change is safe — especially anything in the "Hard rules" list — stop and ask. The cost of pausing is near-zero; the cost of guessing wrong on a hard rule is high.
